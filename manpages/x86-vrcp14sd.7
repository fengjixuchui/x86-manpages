.SS Description
.PP
This instruction performs a SIMD computation of the approximate
reciprocal of the low double\-precision floating\-point value in the
second source operand (the third operand) stores the result in the low
quadword element of the destination operand (the first operand)
according to the writemask k1. Bits (127:64) of the XMM register
destination are copied from corresponding bits in the first source
operand (the second operand). The maximum relative error for this
approximation is less than 2\-14. The source operand can be an XMM
register or a 64\-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM
register.

.PP
The VRCP14SD instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in
the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an ∞ with the sign of
the source value is returned. A denormal source value will be treated as
zero only in case of DAZ bit set in MXCSR. Otherwise it is treated
correctly (i.e. not as a 0.0). Underflow results are flushed to zero
only in case of FTZ bit set in MXCSR. Otherwise it will be treated
correctly (i.e. correct underflow result is written) with the sign of
the operand. When a source value is a SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is
converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned. See Table 5\-22 for
special\-case input values.

.PP
MXCSR exception flags are not affected by this instruction and
floating\-point exceptions are not reported.
