.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes the bit\-wise logical AND of first operand (source 1 operand)
and the second operand (source 2 operand) and sets the SF, ZF, and PF
status flags according to the result. The result is then discarded.

.PP
In 64\-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access
to additional registers (R8\-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of
REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the
beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.

.SH OPERATION
.PP
.RS

.nf
TEMP ← SRC1 AND SRC2;
SF ← MSB(TEMP);
IF TEMP = 0
    THEN ZF ← 1;
    ELSE ZF ← 0;
FI:
PF ← BitwiseXNOR(TEMP[0:7]);
CF ← 0;
OF ← 0;
(* AF is undefined *)

.fi
.RE

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.PP
The OF and CF flags are set to 0. The SF, ZF, and PF flags are set
according to the result (see the “Operation” section above). The state
of the AF flag is undefined.
