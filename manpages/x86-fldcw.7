.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Loads the 16\-bit source operand into the FPU control word. The source
operand is a memory location. This instruction is typically used to
establish or change the FPU’s mode of operation.

.PP
If one or more exception flags are set in the FPU status word prior to
loading a new FPU control word and the new control word unmasks one or
more of those exceptions, a floating\-point exception will be generated
upon execution of the next floating\-point instruction (except for the
no\-wait floating\-point instructions, see the section titled “Software
Exception Handling” in Chapter 8 of the Intel® 64 and IA\-32
Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1). To avoid raising
exceptions when changing FPU operating modes, clear any pending
exceptions (using the FCLEX or FNCLEX instruction) before loading the
new control word.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non\-64\-bit modes and 64\-bit
mode.

.SH FLOATING\-POINT EXCEPTIONS
.PP
None; however, this operation might unmask a pending exception in the
FPU status word. That exception is then generated upon execution of the
next “waiting” floating\-point instruction.
