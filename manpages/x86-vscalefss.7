.SS Description
.PP
Performs a floating\-point scale of the scalar single\-precision
floating\-point value in the first source operand by multiplying it by 2
power of the float32 value in second source operand.

.PP
The equation of this operation is given by:

.PP
xmm1 := xmm2*2floor(xmm3).

.PP
Floor(xmm3) means maximum integer value ≤ xmm3.

.PP
If the result cannot be represented in single precision, then the proper
overflow response (for positive scaling operand), or the proper
underflow response (for negative scaling operand) is issued. The
overflow and underflow responses are dependent on the rounding mode (for
IEEE\-compliant rounding), as well as on other settings in MXCSR
(exception mask bits, FTZ bit), and on the SAE bit.

.PP
EVEX encoded version: The first source operand is an XMM register. The
second source operand is an XMM register or a memory location. The
destination operand is an XMM register conditionally updated with
writemask k1.

.PP
Handling of special\-case input values are listed in Table 5\-32.
