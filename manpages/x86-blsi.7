.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Extracts the lowest set bit from the source operand and set the
corresponding bit in the destination register. All other bits in the
destination operand are zeroed. If no bits are set in the source
operand, BLSI sets all the bits in the destination to 0 and sets ZF and
CF.

.PP
This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual\-8086 mode.
The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64\-bit mode. In 64\-bit mode
operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non\-64\-bit modes.
An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will
cause #UD.

.SH OPERATION

.nf
temp ← (\-SRC) bitwiseAND (SRC);
SF ← temp[OperandSize \-1];
ZF ← (temp = 0);
IF SRC = 0
    CF ← 0;
ELSE
    CF ← 1;
FI
DEST ← temp;

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.PP
ZF and SF are updated based on the result. CF is set if the source is
not zero. OF flags are cleared. AF and PF flags are undefined.
