.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Truncates the value in the source operand (toward 0) to an integral
value and adds that value to the exponent of the destination operand.
The destination and source operands are floating\-point values located in
registers ST(0) and ST(1), respectively. This instruction provides rapid
multiplication or division by integral powers of 2. The following table
shows the results obtained when scaling various classes of numbers,
assuming that neither overflow nor underflow occurs.

.PP
In most cases, only the exponent is changed and the mantissa
(significand) remains unchanged. However, when the value being scaled in
ST(0) is a denormal value, the mantissa is also changed and the result
may turn out to be a normalized number. Similarly, if overflow or
underflow results from a scale operation, the resulting mantissa will
differ from the source’s mantissa.

.PP
The FSCALE instruction can also be used to reverse the action of the
FXTRACT instruction, as shown in the following example:

.PP
FXTRACT;

.PP
FSCALE;

.PP
FSTP ST(1);

.PP
In this example, the FXTRACT instruction extracts the significand and
exponent from the value in ST(0) and stores them in ST(0) and ST(1)
respectively. The FSCALE then scales the significand in ST(0) by the
exponent in ST(1), recreating the original value before the FXTRACT
operation was performed. The FSTP ST(1) instruction overwrites the
exponent (extracted by the FXTRACT instruction) with the recreated
value, which returns the stack to its original state with only one
register [ST(0)] occupied.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non\-64\-bit modes and 64\-bit
mode.
