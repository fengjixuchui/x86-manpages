.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes the approximate cosine of the source operand in register ST(0)
and stores the result in ST(0). The source operand must be given in
radians and must be within the range −263. The following table shows the
results obtained when taking the cosine of various classes of numbers.

.PP
If the source operand is outside the acceptable range, the C2 flag in
the FPU status word is set, and the value in register ST(0) remains
unchanged. The instruction does not raise an exception when the source
operand is out of range. It is up to the program to check the C2 flag
for out\-of\-range conditions. Source values outside the range − 263,
inaccurate results can occur because the finite approximation of π used
internally for argument reduction is not sufficient in all cases.
Therefore, for accurate results it is safe to apply FCOS only to
arguments reduced accurately in software, to a value smaller in absolute
value than 3π/8. See the sections titled “Approximation of Pi” and
“Transcendental Instruction Accuracy” in Chapter 8 of the Intel® 64 and
IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for a
discussion of the proper value to use for π in performing such
reductions.
