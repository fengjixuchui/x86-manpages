.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Performs an unsigned addition of the destination operand (first
operand), the source operand (second operand) and the carry\-flag (CF)
and stores the result in the destination operand. The destination
operand is a general\-purpose register, whereas the source operand can be
a general\-purpose register or memory location. The state of CF can
represent a carry from a previous addition. The instruction sets the CF
flag with the carry generated by the unsigned addition of the operands.

.PP
The ADCX instruction is executed in the context of multi\-precision
addition, where we add a series of operands with a carry\-chain. At the
beginning of a chain of additions, we need to make sure the CF is in a
desired initial state. Often, this initial state needs to be 0, which
can be achieved with an instruction to zero the CF (e.g. XOR).

.PP
This instruction is supported in real mode and virtual\-8086 mode. The
operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64\-bit mode.

.PP
In 64\-bit mode, the default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX
Prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers
(R8\-15). Using REX Prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64
bits.

.PP
ADCX executes normally either inside or outside a transaction region.

.PP
Note: ADCX defines the OF flag differently than the ADD/ADC instructions
as defined in Intel® 64 and IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer’s
Manual, Volume 2A.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED

CF is updated based on result. OF, SF, ZF, AF and PF flags are
unmodified.
