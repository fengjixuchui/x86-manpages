.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Converts two packed single\-precision floating\-point values in the source
operand (second operand) to two packed signed doubleword integers in the
destination operand (first operand). The source operand can be an XMM
register or a 64\-bit memory location. The destination operand is an MMX
technology register. When the source operand is an XMM register, the two
single\-precision floating\-point values are contained in the low quadword
of the register.

.PP
When a conversion is inexact, a truncated (round toward zero) result is
returned. If a converted result is larger than the maximum signed
doubleword integer, the floating\-point invalid exception is raised, and
if this exception is masked, the indefinite integer value (80000000H) is
returned.

.PP
This instruction causes a transition from x87 FPU to MMX technology
operation (that is, the x87 FPU top\-of\-stack pointer is set to 0 and the
x87 FPU tag word is set to all 0s [valid]). If this instruction is
executed while an x87 FPU floating\-point exception is pending, the
exception is handled before the CVTTPS2PI instruction is executed.

.PP
In 64\-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to
access additional registers (XMM8\-XMM15).
