Compute the sine and cosine of ST(0); replace ST(0) with the approximate sine, and push the approximate cosine onto the register stack.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Computes both the approximate sine and the cosine of the source operand
in register ST(0), stores the sine in ST(0), and pushes the cosine onto
the top of the FPU register stack. (This instruction is faster than
executing the FSIN and FCOS instructions in succession.)

.PP
The source operand must be given in radians and must be within the range
−263. The following table shows the results obtained when taking the
sine and cosine of various classes of numbers, assuming that underflow
does not occur.

.PP
If the source operand is outside the acceptable range, the C2 flag in
the FPU status word is set, and the value in register ST(0) remains
unchanged. The instruction does not raise an exception when the source
operand is out of range. It is up to the program to check the C2 flag
for out\-of\-range conditions. Source values outside the range − 263,
inaccurate results can occur because the finite approximation of π used
internally for argument reduction is not sufficient in all cases.
Therefore, for accurate results it is safe to apply FSINCOS only to
arguments reduced accurately in software, to a value smaller in absolute
value than 3π/8. See the sections titled “Approximation of Pi” and
“Transcendental Instruction Accuracy” in Chapter 8 of the Intel® 64 and
IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for a
discussion of the proper value to use for π in performing such
reductions.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non\-64\-bit modes and 64\-bit
mode.
