.SS Description
.PP
This instruction performs a SIMD computation of the approximate
reciprocals of eight/four/two packed double\-precision floating\-point
values in the source operand (the second operand) and stores the packed
double\-precision floating\-point results in the destination operand. The
maximum relative error for this approximation is less than
2\-14\&.

.PP
The source operand can be a ZMM register, a 512\-bit memory location, or
a 512\-bit vector broadcasted from a 64\-bit memory location. The
destination operand is a ZMM register conditionally updated according to
the writemask.

.PP
The VRCP14PD instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in
the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an ∞ with the sign of
the source value is returned. A denormal source value will be treated as
zero only in case of DAZ bit set in MXCSR. Otherwise it is treated
correctly (i.e. not as a 0.0). Underflow results are flushed to zero
only in case of FTZ bit set in MXCSR. Otherwise it will be treated
correctly (i.e. correct underflow result is written) with the sign of
the operand. When a source value is a SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is
converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned.

.PP
EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will
#UD.

.PP
MXCSR exception flags are not affected by this instruction and
floating\-point exceptions are not reported.
