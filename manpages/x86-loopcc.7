.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Performs a loop operation using the RCX, ECX or CX register as a counter
(depending on whether address size is 64 bits, 32 bits, or 16 bits).
Note that the LOOP instruction ignores REX.W; but 64\-bit address size
can be over\-ridden using a 67H prefix.

.PP
Each time the LOOP instruction is executed, the count register is
decremented, then checked for 0. If the count is 0, the loop is
terminated and program execution continues with the instruction
following the LOOP instruction. If the count is not zero, a near jump is
performed to the destination (target) operand, which is presumably the
instruction at the beginning of the loop.

.PP
The target instruction is specified with a relative offset (a signed
offset relative to the current value of the instruction pointer in the
IP/EIP/RIP register). This offset is generally specified as a label in
assembly code, but at the machine code level, it is encoded as a signed,
8\-bit immediate value, which is added to the instruction pointer.
Offsets of –128 to +127 are allowed with this instruction.

.PP
Some forms of the loop instruction (LOOPcc instruction itself does not
affect the state of the ZF flag; the ZF flag is changed by other
instructions in the loop.
