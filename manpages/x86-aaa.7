.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Adjusts the sum of two unpacked BCD values to create an unpacked BCD
result. The AL register is the implied source and destination operand
for this instruction. The AAA instruction is only useful when it follows
an ADD instruction that adds (binary addition) two unpacked BCD values
and stores a byte result in the AL register. The AAA instruction then
adjusts the contents of the AL register to contain the correct 1\-digit
unpacked BCD result.

.PP
If the addition produces a decimal carry, the AH register increments by
1, and the CF and AF flags are set. If there was no decimal carry, the
CF and AF flags are cleared and the AH register is unchanged. In either
case, bits 4 through 7 of the AL register are set to 0.

.PP
This instruction executes as described in compatibility mode and legacy
mode. It is not valid in 64\-bit mode.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
.PP
The AF and CF flags are set to 1 if the adjustment results in a decimal
carry; otherwise they are set to 0. The OF, SF, ZF, and PF flags are
